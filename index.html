          <p>
            We would not be alive if it weren't for the earth. Humans gain
            enormously from the earth's health benefits. The most vital thing
            that earth provides for survival is oxygen. Earth controls the
            complete cycle of breathing of all living beings. The oxygen we
            breathe comes from trees, and the carbon dioxide we exhale is
            absorbed by them.
